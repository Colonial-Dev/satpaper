Satpaper generates live wallpapers for your desktop, using near-real-time imagery from [RAMMB SLIDER](https://rammb-slider.cira.colostate.edu).

There are several satellites to choose from, each covering a different region of the world.
- GOES East (used in the sample image - covers most of North and South America)
- GOES West (Pacific Ocean and parts of the western US)
- Himawari (Oceania and East Asia)
- Meteosat 9 (Africa, Middle East, India, Central Asia)
- Meteosat 10 (Atlantic Ocean, Africa, Europe)

## Warning - Data Usage
Satpaper downloads satellite imagery at the highest available resolution and downscales it to fit your specifications. The exact download size varies depending on which satellite you are using and the image contents, but it's typically in the ballpark of twenty megabytes.

If you're on a metered and/or severely bandwidth-limited connection, twenty megabytes every ten to fifteen minutes can really add up. You have been warned!

## Installation
### Automatically Supported Environments
- GNOME
- KDE
- Windows (tested to work on 10/11)
- macOS (tested to work on Ventura)
    - Satpaper will ask for System Event permission when running for the first time - you will need to grant access then restart the program for it to work.

If your environment is not supported, you have a few options:
- Use the `--wallpaper-command`/`SATPAPER_WALLPAPER_COMMAND` argument to specify a command to run whenever a new wallpaper is generated. 
- Use the `--once` flag to turn Satpaper into a one-off wallpaper generator, allowing it to be integrated into a larger script or program.

PRs to add automatic support are also welcome!

### Precompiled Binaries
Precompiled versions of Satpaper will be available for Linux (compiled against `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, which should Just Workâ„¢ on most distributions) and Windows in the [releases](https://github.com/Colonial-Dev/satpaper/releases) section. (They are currently on hold while I work out some allocator/RAM usage weirdness.)

### From Source

Dependencies:
- The most recent stable [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/).
- A C/C++ toolchain (such as `gcc`.)

Just use `cargo install`, and Satpaper will be compiled and added to your `PATH`.
```sh
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/Colonial-Dev/satpaper --branch master
```

To automatically start Satpaper when you log in, you can use a `systemd` unit or equivalent.

## FAQ

### *Why is Satpaper using hundreds of megs of RAM?*

The short answer is allocator weirdness - I'm actively trying to figure out a fix.

The long answer: Satpaper *does* need several hundred megabytes of RAM when doing compositing - the raw satellite imagery alone is ~450 megabytes after being decompressed and stitched together - and this memory *is* freed upon completion. Valgrind/Massif come out clean, the works.

The issue lies in the fact that (at least on Linux - I haven't tested it elsewhere) `libc`'s `free` seems to think it's fine to just... not return that memory to the operating system. I'm hoping that a correctly-configured alternative allocator (such as `jemalloc` or `mimalloc`) will prevent this issue.

### *Why are continents purple in night imagery?* / *Why does night imagery look kinda weird?*
This is a byproduct of the CIRA GeoColor processing algorithm used to generate full-color images from the raw satellite data. GeoColor uses infrared for night-time imaging, which is then overlaid with false city lights and whitened clouds. The resulting image usually looks pretty good at a glance, but might begin to seem unnatural upon closer inspection.

Unfortunately, this is a necessary evil, as geostationary weather satellites don't capture enough visible spectrum light to generate a true-color night-time image.

### *I live at `$EXTREME_LATITUDE` - is there a way to get better imagery of my location?*
Not really. Geostationary orbits (required for the type of imaging we want) can only be achieved at a very specific altitude directly above the equator.

### *Why am I seeing glitchy imagery from GOES East at night?*
You're most likely seeing something like this:
<p align="center">

<p>

This is not a software error, but is instead lens flare from the Sun peeking over from the other side of the Earth. This is caused by the Earth's tilt, and is most visible in late February and August.
